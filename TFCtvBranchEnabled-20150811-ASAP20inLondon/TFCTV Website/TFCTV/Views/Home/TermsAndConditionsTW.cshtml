                    and subscriber without regard to conflict of law provisions.</p>
                <p>
                    Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms shall not
                    constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of the Terms is
                    found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless
                    agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as
                    reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the Terms remain in full
                    force and effect.</p>
                <p>
                    You agree that unless otherwise provided for by any applicable laws, any claim or
                    cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Service or the Terms must
                    be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever
                    barred.</p>
                <p>
                    If any part of the Terms is found to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, under
                    any enactment or rule of law or by a court or tribunal in any jurisdiction, such
                    invalid, illegal, or unenforceable part should be considered as having been amended
                    to the maximum extent permitted by applicable laws and such invalidity, illegality,
                    or unenforceability shall not have any effect on the remaining parts of the Terms.</p>
                <p>
                    The section titles in the Terms are for convenience and have no legal or contractual
